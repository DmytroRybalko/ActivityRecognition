Here is present my final project in Machine Learning course from AI Booster.  

There is a dataset [Activity Recognition from Single Chest-Mounted Accelerometer Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+from+Single+Chest-Mounted+Accelerometer).  
**Task**: having studied on one person, the model should be able to distinguish it from others.
